Wagner, B. (2023, January 9). *C# programming guide*. Microsoft Learn. <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/>

**Summary:**

This website is a guide about the C# programming language. It has multiple different sections about various aspects of the language, and it has guides for different platforms to use language on too. Along with this, it has many pages about C#'s history, fundamentals, concepts, etc. It's rich with information about C#, and it makes sense why it would be since this is posted on Microsoft's website.

**Evaluation:**

This is a very current source, being put out in 2023. The information on this website is very plentiful and very reliable. It is posted on the Microsoft website, and they were the company who had a huge influence on the creation of C#. This is a very useful website with a lot of helpful information.

**Citation:**

Civeyarc, A.-L. (2019, February 11). *The One Who Created Languages*. Welcome To The Jungle. <https://www.welcometothejungle.com/en/articles/anders-hejlsberg-microsoft-career>

**Summary:**

This website is about Anders Hejlsberg, the person behind the creation of the C# programming language. It gives a strong history of what he has done previously and what he has accomplished. This website goes in depth on a handful of different aspects about Hejlsberg that are fundamental.

**Evaluation:**

This is a current source, being published in 2019. The publishers, Welcome to The Jungle, are a reliable website. They have published many articles that concern the computer science field, and they are still publishing articles today. This website can be useful for some history about the person who created C#.

**Summary:**

This article is about asynchronous programming in C#, and it specifically looks into a study and toolkit about asynchronous programming. The authors explain what asynchronous programming is and why it is in demand. The authors present the first study that analyzes asynchronous programming in a large experiment. The authors explain in depth about their study and why it is important.

**Evaluation:**

This article is somewhat recent, since it was published in 2014. I assume the authors are trustworthy and that it is a reliable source since I found it in a database at Xavier's online library. Some works have also cited this article, which helps with reliability. It is a little outdated, but asynchronous programming seems to be a prevalent topic in the C# programming language. I think this could help with the case study and provide some valuable information.

**Summary:**

This article is about asynchronous programming in C#, and it specifically looks at static deadlock detection. The authors of this article explain what static deadlock detection in asynchronous C# programs is, and state how it is a prevalent problem. Then they go into their representation for control flow and scheduling for asynchronous programs in C#.

**Evaluation:**

This article is relatively recent, being published in 2017. The author and contents of the article seem to be reliable since I retrieved it from a database in Xavier's online library. The contents of the article interested me, and asynchronous programming looks to be a popular and interesting topic with C#. I believe this article could help contribute to the case study.

Sebesta, R. (2019). *Concepts of Programming Languages* (12^th^ ed.). Pearson.

**Summary:**

Our class textbook has a lot of information about the C# programming language. It is also easy to get to this information about C# by using the index in the online textbook. This information can be helpful in the case study as well.

**Evaluation:**

Our class textbook is a current source since it was published in 2019. This is a very reliable source since it is being used as our class textbook. The information about C# is accurate and fundamental.

(Link: https://dl-acm-org.xavier.idm.oclc.org/doi/10.1145/1297846.1297922)

**Summary:**

This website is about querying in C# and how LINQ can work with this. The author describes in depth how LINQ works and why it is useful to use for querying data in C#. He does this on version 3.0 of C#, so it is a little outdated.

**Evaluation:**

The article was published in 2007, so it is a little old. The author also is using version 3.0 of C#, so this is another reason why it could be an unreliable source. I assume the article is very trustworthy since the author has been cited in many other sources, and this article was retrieved by using a library database. I thought the contents of the article were interesting and could be a topic to cover in the case study.
